TODO: Someone explain this stuff later

## Branches

Master branch is our **status quo**.
If you wish to change the status quo, you need to go through the **peer-review process**. The process starts with creating new RFC document.

> How to create new RFC document?

1. Go to project root directory.
2. Create new branch for your proposal. Use concise and specific name. Check list of active branches for inspiration.
3. Create a markdown document under the same name. Write merits of your proposal down there.
5. When ready, send us pull request.

> What next?

Your proposal will have to pass through peer-review stages.
It starts its life as **fresh**.
At this point someone should implement a **proof of concept**.
Reviewed and accepted proof of concept gains status of **unstable**.
After enough testing and gaining stability, it is marked as **stable**.
After enough time without issues alongside with gaining sufficient popularity,
the document will be accepted as status quo.
