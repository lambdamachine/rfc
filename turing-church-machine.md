# Turing-Church Machine

TODO: Explain the concepts

> Why Turing-Church?

Because Turing Machine meets Alonzo Church's Lambda Calculus.

In a nutshell, _Turing-Church Machine_, or as we call it _Lambda Machine_, 
is an implementation of Turing Machine with infinite "Tape", 
programmable and optimized for lambda calculus.

## Purpose

Minimal general purpose environment for rapid software development.
